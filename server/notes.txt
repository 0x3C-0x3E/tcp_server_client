# Sever architecture

as networking is a recieve-response modell it makes sense to have a thread that recieves and handles the data and another thread, that sends back the data to resond with
this is why for every client there are two threads in a ClientThreadCollection struct

also i am too lazy to really document all this, so good luck if you wanna understand how to use this stuff :)
